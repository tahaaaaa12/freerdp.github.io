<p>FreeRDP community,</p>
<p>Here is the moment you have all been waiting for: the Thinstuff Android client has finally been released! An announcement has been made by Thinstuff on the mailing list:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Thinstuff is proud to announce that aFreeRDP, the FreeRDP Android<br />
client, is now available in git master.</p>
<p>The initial announcement was made too early, and we have run behind<br />
schedule. We apologize for the inconvenience and for the lack of status<br />
update on our side. However, we believe that this release was well worth<br />
the wait, and that you will be impressed with it.</p>
<p>aFreeRDP is already quite mature and comes with a lot of nice features:<br />
- Built-in help for touch pointer and gestures<br />
- A touch pointer for easier user input within a session<br />
- Gestures for common input tasks like scrolling, zooming, etc.<br />
- Custom keyboard views for advanced user input (i.e. common shortcuts<br />
like Win+E)<br />
- A flexible connection management UI allowing to quickly connect to a<br />
host as well as handling a large list with multiple predefined<br />
connections</p>
<p>The build integrates seamlessly into FreeRDPs build system &#8211; you just<br />
have to install the Android NDK/SDK and ant. For detailed instructions<br />
on how to build aFreeRDP refer to docs/README.android.</p>
<p>Thinstuff strongly believes in FreeRDP and we think that aFreeRDP is a<br />
perfect addition to the available clients. We hope you like it <img src='http://www.freerdp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>your Thinstuff Team</p></blockquote>
